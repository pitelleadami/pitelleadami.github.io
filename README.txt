I made it so it looks similar to the poster I made on Illustrator. I used the same typefaces, weight and leading. I followed the same positioning on the 12 column grid as I did on Typography1. The only possible difference would be the fonts, for which I input alternative font on the code in case the original one I used isn't supported by the browser.
